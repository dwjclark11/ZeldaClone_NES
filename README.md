# ZeldaClone_NES
This game was inspired by the 2D Game Engine course from Pikuma.com. Big thanks to Gustavo Pezzi for the inspiration. I have taken what I 
learned from that course to help me develop this Zelda Clone. 
This game was created for educational purposes and to help develop my skills with C++, Lua, and understanding
of data management. 

This game/engine includes the following:
- An ECS (Entity Component System) to help manage entities, components, and systems that are in the game.
- A functioning Tilemap Editor that can create:
        - Tilemaps 
        - colliders
        - triggers (transport/secret areas/ traps/ etc.)
        - Uses Dear ImGui as the user interface
- The game engine is currently done in SDL; however, I am in the works of switching the engine to use OpenGL.
- This game/engine is not finished and I am actively working on it so it can be a great demo and learning experience.
